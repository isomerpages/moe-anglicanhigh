##### Overviews
Anglican House welcomed its first student residents in 1983. Throughout these years, Anglican House provides a conducive and friendly environment for all its boarders and seeks to improve its facilities. Hostel life gives students the opportunity to experience independent living, while allowing for close interactions with other boarders. Our hostel wardens and mentors work to create a close-knit family culture by providing strong personal support for our boarders.
