Our students do best when schools and parents work hand in hand to support them. As part of our school-home partnership, our Parent Support Group plays a key role in inspiring and guiding parents who wish to contribute to the school’s efforts, coordinating their time and effort effectively to give our students the best educational experience.&nbsp;

### Parent Support Group


The AHS Parent Support Group (PSG) welcomes parents of current AHS students to join us. We are a group of mums and dads volunteering our time and talents for the school. Through our programmes and activities, we walk together with the school towards our common vision to nurture each AHS student into a leader who leads honourably, learns for life, and creates value for others.  
  
All parents in AHS are automatically part of the school’s PSG where they can participate in activities that the school regularly organises for families. Some parents may come forward as Active Volunteers to plan and/or assist in various activities and administration areas; while others may take on the role as Class Ambassador for his/her child's class. The PSG in AHS is categorised into two sub-groups – the Very Caring Parents and CHAMPS Advocates.

### Very Caring Parents (VCP)


We are part of the Ministry of Social and Family Development’s FamilyMatters@School programme. We organise periodic workshops and bonding activities to empower and equip parents to build strong and happy families. Through enriching workshops, activities and resources, parents can learn how to build healthy communication with their children and nurture positive relationships within the family.

We are also involved in initiatives like Mid-Autumn Festival, Holistic Health, National Education and Learning Journeys. Parents who volunteer as Class Ambassadors also come under the wings of the VCP.

  

### CHAMPS Advocates


CHAMPS Advocates was set up in 2013 as an offshoot of PSG specially for parents who are passionate in value adding and expanding the realms of development in our students. The mission of CHAMPS Advocates is to work hand in hand with the school to nurture our children in the domains of:

Our Advocates have ignited the passion in our students by opening up their workplaces on "Bring Your Child to Work Day", and sharing their professional experience with our students on AHS Career Day.
