#### 68th Founders’ Day

<p align="justify">
Themed ‘Leading Honourably 秉公行义’, our 68th Founder's Day was held on 17 May 2024. We were honoured to have Dr. Koh Khee Heong, Associate Professor of Chinese Studies at NUS and an alumnus from the Class of 1990, as our esteemed Guest-of-Honour. We celebrated academic excellence by presenting numerous awards to outstanding students, recognising their hard work and dedication. Additionally, we honoured our esteemed teachers for their many years of unwavering service and commitment to education. The event was enriched by captivating performances from our talented Choir and Concert Band, adding a touch of artistry and joy to the occasion. This special day not only showcased the achievements within our school community but also reinforced the values of leadership and honour that we strive to instill in our students. It was a day filled with pride, joy, and inspiration for all.</p>

Reflecting on this school year, I am filled with immense gratitude and pride. Being on stage to receive an award was both an exhilarating and humbling experience. This achievement would not have been possible without the unwavering support and patience of my teachers. Despite the challenge of missing one period of lessons weekly, they ensured I stayed on track and continued to excel. I am truly grateful for this opportunity and for the recognition of my efforts. This moment has inspired me to strive for excellence in all my endeavours. - [Goh Jing Jing, 3E] </p>
