### Founder's Day 2020

The school welcomed back the outstanding Secondary 4 students of 2019 on 22 July 2020. Bright, sunny weather delightfully greeted these Secondary 4 students who returned back to the AHS campus after graduating from the school.

Each student received the award from the Principal, Mr Khoo and took a photograph with Mr Khoo in front of “我爱圣中” monument, depicting their love and four years of fond memories for the school. 

This year, 26 students received medals of commendation for their excellent GCE ‘O’ level 2019 results. 6 students received Siow Miow Yew Humanities Award. 4 students received Outstanding Students Awards. The highlight of the ceremony was Ang Soo Hui of 4C who awarded with AHS Student of the Year.

“Seeing the students receiving recognition for their achievements was very touching for me. These students have grown and gained immensely from their education in AHS. I hope they will continue to develop and make the school proud, by making a positive impact and creating value for others.” – Mr Jimmy Tan, Teacher
