#### 67th Founders’ Day

<p align="justify">
On 19 May 2023, Anglican High School celebrated its 67th Founders’ Day with the theme ‘Creating Value for Others’. We give thanks for God’s grace, which has allowed our school to flourish and grow stronger over the past 67 years!  </p>

The day commenced with the official opening of AHS’ newest performing arts venue, the Glory Performing Studio (荣耀艺术工作室), by our Guest-of-Honour, Reverend David Lee, Chairman of the Education Board Diocese of Singapore, who is also an alumnus. Together with the other guests, he was welcomed by our Sec 4 Music students, who performed a lively percussion piece titled ‘Carefree 童乐’ composed by Singaporean composer Benjamin Boo.  </p>

The Founders’ Day ceremony kicked off with a majestic march-in led by representatives from our 22 Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs), each proudly displaying their respective CCA colours. Our Principal, Mr Khoo, delivered an uplifting address on our vision of nurturing honourable leaders committed to creating value for others. Our Guest-of-Honour, Reverend David Lee, also gave an inspiring speech that encouraged our students to continue serving with love, humility and empathy.
