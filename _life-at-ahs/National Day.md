The school’s annual combined celebration, comprising National Day, Partners’ Day and Student Leaders’ Investiture, was held on 8 August 2023, with the theme, ‘Onward as One’. </p>

In the pre-parade segment, our Secondary 3 and 4 students were joined by staff and students from Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah for a class bonding activity, as part of our effort to expose our students to different cultures. Our guests also performed during the celebrations.</p>

**Reflections**
<p align="justify">
“As the Parade Commander (PC), I enjoyed the whole experience, from getting to know the drill standards to refining little mistakes. I am really grateful for working together with the PSM and CSM, which enabled us to attain the high drill standards showcased on the final day.  Through working with the contingent, I have forged many new friendships that I will dearly cherish. NDP has taught me to be disciplined, to stay on task and persevere through all the hardships, as the end result would be worthwhile.” - Joel Tay Yong En, 3H</p>

“As the Parade Sergeant Major (PSM), I feel extremely grateful to be given this opportunity to not only lead the NDP participants in working towards a common goal, but to also improve everyone’s drill standards. Through much rigorous training and teamwork with the PC and CSM, we were able to improve on various weaknesses, and also enhance the NDP participants’ strengths, allowing us to deliver a fantastic performance that we are truly proud of. I am indeed very appreciative of this wonderful opportunity as it has not only allowed me to establish new friendships with many different people, but it has also challenged me greatly as a leader, allowing me to learn what truly is the essence of being a leader - being vision-centered, resilient in the face of adversity, and strong-willed. I truly am thankful for the experiences and lessons gained from NDP.” - Cheng Shi Hui Chloe, 3E</p>

“I'm extremely grateful to have had the opportunity to be the Colours Sergeant Major (CSM) for NDP 2023. This role has taught me how to be a better leader. Working alongside Joel and Chloe, I was able to develop my communication skills, planning each training and working together to sharpen the Parade's drills. Although it was challenging to learn new drills to guide the Colours Party, I genuinely enjoyed it! From the "Yammmm Seng" moments during water parades to shouting "圣中!" at the end of each rehearsal, I cherish all the memories I've made and the new people I've met. I'd like to thank Mr Leong, Ms Koh, Mr Clement and Mr Yeo for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Thanks to them, I was able to serve my fellow batchmates and juniors with pride and joy!” - Melody Teo Min Hui, 3F</p>
