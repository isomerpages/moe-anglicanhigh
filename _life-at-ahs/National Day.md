#### National Day &amp; Partners’ Day

<p align="justify">
Our school's National Day and Partners' Day celebration on 8 August 2024, themed 'Together, As One United People', was filled with excitement and pride.

The day started with a class bonding session, where students spent quality time with their classmates and Form Teachers over breakfast. They received National Day souvenirs, applied temporary tattoos, and some even enjoyed their own class karaoke sessions. The Secondary 3 students were joined by staff and students from St. Andrew's Autism School, fostering a deeper appreciation and understanding of students with various special needs.

Planned and executed by the Exco members from the Uniformed Groups and Performing Arts, the event began with Act 1, ‘Standing on the Shoulders of Giants’. We were honoured by the presence of guests from All Saints’ Church, the Parents Support Group, St. Andrew’s Autism School, and Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah. This segment featured a live stream of the tree-planting ceremony, followed by the Partners’ Day Award ceremony.

Act 2, ‘Celebrating the Singapore Spirit’, opened with an energetic performance by our Dancers, followed by a captivating portrayal of tradition, kampong spirit, and unity by the Chinese Drama members. The much-anticipated Parade and Ceremony saw students from the Uniformed Groups marching into the hall with pride, accompanied by the Concert Band, who played the National Anthem, which we all sang with enthusiasm.

The final segment, Act 3, ‘Forging Ahead with The Singapore Spirit’, featured breathtaking performances by the Freestyle Drill Squad and Precision Drill Squad, whose synchronised movements, creative choreography, and high-energy routines wowed the audience. The trivia host segment was also a hit, engaging both students and guests with interactive questions and prizes, adding a fun and informative twist to the celebration.

The Choir’s closing performance filled the hall with joy, as their passionate renditions of uplifting songs perfectly encapsulated the spirit of the day. The event concluded on a high note, leaving everyone with a renewed sense of camaraderie and national pride.
