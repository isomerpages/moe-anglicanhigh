#### AHS Family Fiesta

<p align="justify">
On the morning of 9 March 2024, the AHS family gathered at the school field for our all-time favourite, the AHS Family Fiesta. The day kicked off with various stakeholders joining students and staff for 早操, before setting out on a walk around the Fengshan neighbourhood. Many parents turned up to support the event, walking alongside their children and capturing these precious moments in countless photos. In addition to the usual food and game booths, the event featured friendly basketball matches between our alumni and the current ‘C’ Division boys, with the oldest alumnus participant having graduated in 1991!
	
Once again, we demonstrated the strength of our school spirit through the collective effort of the AHS family, and we look forward to AHS Family Fiesta 2025!</p>

Family Fiesta was awesome! The most meaningful part was reliving all those memories with my sister (also an alumna) while watching my son walk the grounds of AHS as a Sec 1 student. - [Mrs Lim, alumna and parent of Sec 1 student]

It was great to have the freedom to walk around with our friends, giving us the chance to strengthen bonds with both friends and family, and even connect with people in CCA that we hadn’t spoken to before! - [Goh Rui En Abigail, 1H]</p>
