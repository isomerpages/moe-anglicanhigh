#### AHS Family Fiesta 2022

AHS Family Fiesta is back! 

<p align="justify">
After a two-year hiatus due to COVID-19, our AHS family could finally gather to have some fun on 27 May 2022. Like past AHS Family Fiestas, all students and staff started the morning with our AHS 早操 and iLoveAHS walk around our neighbourhood. Teachers and students enjoyed a morning of fun and fellowship with each other as they participated in the interclass games and creative carnival game booths set up by the Sec 3 CCA leaders.

We are truly thankful that we are able to gather together again to celebrate God's goodness in guiding our school!</p>
