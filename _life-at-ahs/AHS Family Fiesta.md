#### AHS Family Fiesta 2023

<p align="justify">
The whole school gathered alongside our various stakeholders on Saturday, 11th March 2023, for our all-time favourite AHS Family Fiesta. We started the day with a whole school 早操 at the school field, followed by a walk around the Fengshan neighbourhood. The school buzzed with energy when we launched the Fiesta’s food and game booths, organised by the CCAs, PSG and canteen vendors. Students were seen queuing up for bubble tea, engaging in lively chats with their friends and showcasing their skills at the Dunk Basket, where they attempted to dunk their teachers.</p>

We continued having the inter-class Captain’s Ball competition for the different levels at the ISH where students and teachers cheered their hearts out for their respective classes.</p>

Once again, we demonstrated a strong school spirit through the combined efforts of the AHS family and we look forward to AHS Family Fiesta 2024! </p>
