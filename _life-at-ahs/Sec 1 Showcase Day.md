#### Sec 1 Showcase Day

<p align="justify">
Sec One Showcase Day is an annual platform for our Sec One students to showcase their achievements, and to celebrate and affirm the good work they have done in their first year with us. </p>

<p align="justify">
Themed ‘A Celebration of Learning’, every Sec One student has the opportunity to showcase and present his/her proudest learning experience to his/her classmates and parents. Parents beamed with pride as they watched their child present confidently what they have learnt in their first year of secondary school. </p>

<p align="justify">
Apart from showcasing their learning, the event also culminated in a significant segment where students and parents presented cards of appreciation and affirmation respectively to each other. It was a heartwarming moment to see the happy faces of parents receiving the card from their child and the sheer sense of affirmation when students received the letter of affirmation from their parents.</p>

It was indeed a lovely evening on the last day of the academic year as the AHS family came together to celebrate and affirm our Sec One students’ efforts to Soar, Shine and Serve!</p>
