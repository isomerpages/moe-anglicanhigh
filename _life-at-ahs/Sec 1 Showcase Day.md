The school believes that Every Student has Talent, and Every Student can Excel. We provide an annual platform for our Sec One students to showcase their achievements, and to celebrate and affirm the good work accomplished by our students in their first year with us. All students get the opportunity to present their work to their parents and other visitors at their booths, while honing their communication skills at the same time. There was a wide variety of works presented, including Music Rendition of Self-Composed Songs, Live Cooking, Chinese Flute, Chinese Painting, Science models, Geographical and Historical Investigative Projects, Poetry Slams, Mathematics Matching Game, Travel Scrapbooks, and Coding. Parents commented that they appreciated the hard work and efforts put in by the students, and were impressed with the enthusiasm of our students. Good Job Sec Ones!
