School is about making memories and good times with friends that will last forever.

It's always fun working at the Cool Creme Cafe. I learn valuable skills like managing logistics in F&B and teamwork! - Hannah Goh (3H)

The food at Cafe Forty31@Anglican is really scrumptious! The drinks there are so refreshing and the food is so flavourful and delicious! I always look forward to coming here with my friends after school!  - Pan Siyu (1D)
