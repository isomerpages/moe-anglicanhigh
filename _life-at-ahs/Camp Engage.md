Held in the first week of school, Camp Engage aims to welcome our Sec 1s to 4s back to a new school year through meaningful activities where they can gain invaluable experiences, learn useful skills, and forge new friendships. 新学年，新开始，无限精彩！</p>

<b>Secondary One</b>

The Sec 1s embarked on a fun-filled orientation organised by the Student Council. Themed “Mission Impossible”, the activities were designed for the Sec 1s to bond with their new classmates, venture beyond their comfort zone, and progress to Mission: I’m Possible! </p>

The Sec 3s attended a 3D2N camp in school that focused on building group dynamics, leadership skills and positive communication through challenges such as Human Entanglement and Night Walk. They also experienced outdoor skills like tent-pitching and outdoor cooking. It was indeed a journey of self-discovery as they bonded with their new classmates. </p>

My biggest takeaway is to be able to make new friends and most importantly to build strong relationships with my friends and family.</p>

I'm glad that the Secondary 1s were able to know each other better and grow comfortable around each other. It was very heart warming seeing them working together to complete the games. - Alice Ang Chee Suan 4F</p>

I had a senior who helped make my school life easier. Once, when I was lost while trying to find my class, a senior stepped in to help me. She further encouraged me to speak up and talk more to others. This helped me to adjust to secondary school life.   - Lee Enn 1J</p>
