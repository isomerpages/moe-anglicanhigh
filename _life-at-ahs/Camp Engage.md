The Sec 1s embarked on a fun-filled orientation organised by the Student Council. Themed “Mission Impossible”, the activities were designed for the Sec 1s to bond with their new classmates, venture beyond their comfort zone, and progress to Mission: I’m Possible! </p>

The Sec 3s attended a 3D2N camp in school that focused on building group dynamics, leadership skills and positive communication through challenges such as Human Entanglement and Night Walk.

The Sec 4s went on Learning Journeys to different organisations, and had a taste of different career options and the significance of these industries to our nation. They also participated in activities of their choice such as kickboxing and Rubik’s Cube art. In addition, the Sec 4s also headed out to the neighbouring housing estate to collect clothes for recycling, with the proceeds donated to St Andrew’s Autism Centre.</p>
