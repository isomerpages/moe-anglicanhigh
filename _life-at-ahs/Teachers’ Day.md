#### Teachers' Day Celebration

<p align="justify">
The Teachers’ Day Celebration is a cherished annual event celebrated by both staff and students. With the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, the event, planned by Student Councillors and the Student Leadership Team, were finally held ‘live’ once again this year. The celebration started with activities planned by classes for their teachers to express their gratitude. This was followed by a ‘Walk of Fame’ which saw teachers dressed up as rock stars as they sashayed into the hall. It was a hit with the students, to say the least. The English Drama and AHS Got Talent (AGT) teams also worked together to deliver an incredible performance that included a skit, conveying that teachers were always there for their students. The audience was also enraptured by the lively performances of our talented students in AGT. The event then ended with a bang as all AGT talents came together for a memorable musical performance. This was truly a heartfelt and unforgettable event. </p>
