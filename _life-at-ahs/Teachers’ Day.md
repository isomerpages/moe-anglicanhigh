#### Teachers’ Day Celebration &amp; AHS Got Talent Finals

<p align="justify">
The theme for Teachers’ Day 2023 was ‘Out of this World’. This theme was chosen to remind teachers that their commitment and dedication to ensure all students grow and develop is truly out of this world. Thanks to the amazing performances by our AHS’ Got Talent finalists and English Drama members, the concert was exciting, entertaining and heartwarming. In addition, we also had our annual red carpet walk-in by teachers, who were all dressed up to the theme! The success of this event would not have been possible if not for the enthusiasm and energy of both students and teachers! </p>
