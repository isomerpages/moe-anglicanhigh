#### Teachers’ Day Celebration 2024

<p align="justify">
This year's Teachers' Day at Anglican High School was a heartfelt celebration of the timeless dedication and love that teachers extend to their students, captured by the theme "Teachers Through Time." The event began with a drama production by the English Drama, which took the audience on a journey through the decades. Following the drama, the stage was set for ‘Anglican's Got Talent’, where our students’ talents shone brightly. It featured elegant dance routines, two vibrant band performances, and a hilarious skit. The festivities continued with a series of interactive and exciting games, where teachers and students teamed up to compete.

Through every generation, teachers have continued to inspire, guide, and love their students, making this year's Teachers' Day a powerful reminder of their timeless impact.</p>

As it was my first time planning such a large-scale event, it made me realise that planning isn't as easy as it seems. Planning the event gave me a sense of satisfaction and I was really very happy that the event went smoothly!  - [Lee Bo Xuan 2C] </p>

When Abel and I first registered, we really didn’t expect to win AGT! We prepared everything that we could, from a budgeted Chinese traditional hat to a 3-part story on teachers through time. It felt amazing winning AGT together with my best buddy.  - [Richard Soong Yong Jun, 3A] </p>
