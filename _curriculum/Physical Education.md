#### Our Approach
Physical Education is an important component in school to help develop our students holistically. In AHS, we aim to develop students who are physically competent and confident who enjoy an active and healthy lifestyle. Through the four years PE curriculum, students will improve their movement competency and concepts to take part in various physical activities. Students will learn about the importance and benefits of leading an active and healthy lifestyle and learn to be responsible for their well-being. Students will make informed and responsible decisions during lessons based on school-based values. 

#### Learner Outcomes

The PE curriculum aims to foster confidence in students who can apply the skills and knowledge taught and continue to learn and participate in recreational physical activities even well after school’s life. Three learning areas are covered in the 4 years curriculum.
The PE curriculum aims to foster confidence in students who can apply the skills and knowledge taught and continue to learn and participate in recreational physical activities even well after school’s life. Three learning areas are covered in the 4 years curriculum.

**i) Physical Activity**<br>
Students will learn specific skills and concepts of 5 sports which will improve their movement competence and build their confidence to sustain their healthy lifestyle in their post-secondary years.

**ii) Outdoor Education**<br>
Students will learn more about navigation, shelter building and outdoor cooking. Students will apply their outdoor competencies during tasks such as cohort camps where they will further hone their spirit of adventure and perseverance. 

**iii) Physical Health and Safety**<br>
Students develop an understanding of physical health concepts, active living and safe practices. With these understandings, students can take part in physical activities regularly and safely, where they will always make healthier choices and take good care of themselves.
