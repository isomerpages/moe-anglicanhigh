The project ends with a pitch, where each group presents their innovative packaging to the class.<br><br>
Students also learn about food, nutrition and healthy food preparation through an experiential task. They apply the principles of Design Thinking to plan and prepare a healthy and appetising meal suitable for a person with a diet-related condition, such as diabetes and hypertension.
