##### 'O' level Computing

In 2023, AHS welcomed our first batch of Sec 3 students taking ‘O’ level Computing. The ‘O’ level Computing syllabus aims to provide students with the foundation to continue with further studies in computing, and the requisite skills to participate in a rapidly changing technological environment. The concepts and skills learnt in this ‘O’ level discipline would also be applicable in other fields that require computing

Our Computing students represented AHS in various competitions and programmes that stretched their talents and challenged them to use their programming skills to create value for others in the community. These include Splash Awards, Swift Explorers Singapore, National Digital Explorers, IDE Code Hackers, and stretch programmes by National University of Singapore Centre for Nurturing Computing Excellence.

To give our students a broader perspective beyond the ‘O’ level curriculum, we invited alumnus Dylan Alden Kusbiyantoro (Class of 2022) to share his experience pursuing H2 Computing at Victoria Junior College. Mr Eric Chia (Class of 1993), CEO of Advocado, was invited to join in for our student presentations on their game development project. His feedback for the students provided valuable insights from the industry perspective, sharpening our students’ thinking. Eric also mentored the Splash Awards team in their app development idea, with the team making it to the top 24 pre-tertiary teams in Singapore!
