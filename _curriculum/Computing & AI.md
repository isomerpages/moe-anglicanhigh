#### 'O' level Computing
<p align="justify">
In 2023, AHS welcomed our first batch of Sec 3 students taking ‘O’ level Computing. The ‘O’ level Computing syllabus aims to provide students with the foundation to continue with further studies in computing, and the requisite skills to participate in a rapidly changing technological environment. The concepts and skills learnt in this ‘O’ level discipline would also be applicable in other fields that require computing.</p>
<p align="justify">
Our Computing students represented AHS in various competitions and programmes that stretched their talents and challenged them to use their programming skills to create value for others in the community. These include Splash Awards, Swift Explorers Singapore, National Digital Explorers, IDE Code Hackers, and stretch programmes by National University of Singapore Centre for Nurturing Computing Excellence.</p>
<p align="justify">
To give our students a broader perspective beyond the ‘O’ level curriculum, we invited alumnus Dylan Alden Kusbiyantoro (Class of 2022) to share his experience pursuing H2 Computing at Victoria Junior College. Mr Eric Chia (Class of 1993), CEO of Advocado, was invited to join in for our student presentations on their game development project. His feedback for the students provided valuable insights from the industry perspective, sharpening our students’ thinking. Eric also mentored the Splash Awards team in their app development idea, with the team making it to the top 24 pre-tertiary teams in Singapore!</p>

“Joining Splash Awards has allowed me to experience the process of bringing ideas to life, starting from understanding societal issues to implementing an app for improvement. Working with our mentor, Mr Eric, and Advocado's UI/UX team, we learnt about design specificity and the life of a designer. This experience has enabled me to improve my design thinking, communication and collaboration skills!”</p>

#### Artificial Intelligence

<p align="justify">
To empower our students with the knowledge, skills and right attitudes in the use of Artificial Intelligence, all Secondary 2 students attend a weekly lesson on A.I. that is specially designed and conducted by AHS teachers. This AI curriculum aims to foster AI literacy amongst the students in the following areas:</p>



| |  | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| AI Knowledge    | To equip students with knowledge of the core AI concepts and understand their applications in the AI-integrated world.     | 
| AI Skills    | To equip students with basic programming and computational thinking skills to enable them to function in an AI-integrated society proficiently.     | 
| AI Attitude     | To enable students to critically evaluate AI, recognise the potential ethical issues of using AI technologies and to use AI for the benefit of humanity.    | 

<p align="justify">
Students have hands-on learning on machine learning concepts and the importance of quality training data, natural language processing and speech recognition. Students also engage in discussions on the pros and cons of AI applications, such as ChatGPT and deepfake technology.</p>
