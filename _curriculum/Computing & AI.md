#### Our Approach 
<p align="justify">
With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), it is crucial to empower our students with the knowledge, skills and right attitudes to use AI for good. Launched in 2021, all Secondary 2 students attend a weekly lesson on AI that is designed and conducted by AHS teachers. Through interactive activities, students learn key AI concepts such as natural language processing, machine learning and the importance of quality training data. Students also engage in discussions on the societal impact of AI applications, such as ChatGPT and deepfake technology.
	
In 2023, AHS welcomed our first batch of Sec 3 students taking ‘O’ level Computing. Our key approach lies in computational thinking, where students are taught to break down complex problems, analyse patterns and develop a logical approach to solve the problems in the 21st Century context.

#### Learner Outcomes  
The AI curriculum aims to foster AI literacy amongst the students in the following areas:
| |  | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| AI Knowledge    | To equip students with knowledge of the core AI concepts and understand their applications in the AI-integrated world.    | 
| AI Skills    | To equip students with basic programming and computational thinking skills to enable them to function in an AI-integrated society proficiently.     | 
| AI Attitude     | To enable students to critically evaluate AI, recognise the potential ethical issues of using AI technologies and to use AI for the benefit of humanity.   | 

The ‘O’ level Computing curriculum aims to provide students with the foundation to continue with further studies in computing, and the requisite skills to participate in a rapidly changing technological environment. Students will be able to:<br>
●	Acquire knowledge and understanding of the computing concepts of logic, algorithms, data analysis, data representation and networking.<br>
●	Develop and apply computational thinking skills such as abstraction and decomposition to solve real-world problems by designing, writing, testing and debugging programs.<br>
●	Develop an appreciation of computing as a dynamic and creative field including awareness of recent developments in computer systems.<br>
●	Develop an understanding of the social, ethical, legal and economic implications of computing.<br>
●	Develop attitudes and 21CC needed to do well in computing such as inventive thinking, perseverance, collaboration, communication as well as striving for accuracy and thoroughness.<br>

“Joining Splash Awards has allowed me to experience the process of bringing ideas to life, starting from understanding societal issues to implementing an app for improvement. Working with our mentor, Mr Eric, and Advocado's UI/UX team, we learnt about design specificity and the life of a designer. This experience has enabled me to improve my design thinking, communication and collaboration skills!”</p>
