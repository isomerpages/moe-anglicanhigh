Through the PSL training, I have learnt ways to phrase my questions to subtly encourage others to open up and comfortably share their worries and feelings. I have also learnt the importance of timing, sensing the situation and deciding whether or not it is appropriate to have a heart-to-heart talk. Personally, I dislike the feeling of knowing about a friend’s difficult situation, yet doing nothing to help. It is my personal goal to cheer a friend up or be a listening ear to them.</p>

As students, we may face difficult times that are hard to shoulder alone. This is why peer support is important for those going through tough times. As a Peer Support Leader, I have learnt how crucial it is to have a compassionate and open mindset when comforting others. I have learnt to put myself in others’ shoes and imagine their experience as though it were my own. This deep sense of empathy allows me to identify with their problems to better provide them with moral support.</p>
