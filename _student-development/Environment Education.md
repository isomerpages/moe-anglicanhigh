### Environment Education
At Anglican High School, we envision our students as leaders who lead honourably, learn for life and create value for others. Through our environmental education programme, our students not only learn about sustainability and the environment, they also put into practice the good habits to care for our environment, and champion for causes that will create a better living enviroment.

To reinforce the values of responsibility and respect for the environment, the school collaborates with government agencies (e.g. PUB and NEA), industry parters (e.g. ASTAR) and community partners (e.g. South East CDC and Fengshan CC). These partnerships are valuable to provide our students with:  
- authentic learning experiences to learn about our local natural resources and environmental issues
- opportunities to practice environment-friendly habits such as reducing, reusing and recycling waste
- platforms to lead and influence change for eco-friendly practices.

### Environmental Ambassadors
To encourage students to take the lead in championing environmental-friendly practices, every class has two environmental ambassadors who:
- Take charge of the duty roster, ensuring that the classroom is clean and conducive for learning. 
- Promote environmentally friendly practices within the class. 
- Assist in the running of school environmental campaigns. E.g.  AHS E-waste challenge.  
- Conduct a biodiversity survey of the birds sighted in school using the SGBioAtlas app.
