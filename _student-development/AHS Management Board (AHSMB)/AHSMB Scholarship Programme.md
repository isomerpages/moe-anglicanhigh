### AHS Management Board (AHSMB) Scholarship Programme
The AHSMB Scholarship is offered to outstanding students who demonstrate the passion and potential to grow into future-shaping leaders.

The scholarship aims to nurture motivated, mission-minded leaders by developing skills of critical thinking and learning from others.

The scholarship programme is a 4-year developmental programme that develops core skills in the domains of Thinking Critically, Interacting with Others, and Future-Readiness. These clusters consist of skills that are deemed essential in work places.
