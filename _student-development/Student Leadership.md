In Anglican High School, every student is a leader - a servant leader.

<p align="justify">
Our Student Leadership programme is centred on the philosophy of Servant Leadership. We aim to inspire AHS Students to have a heart for the community and influence the people around them to also do good for others.</p>

<p align="justify">
Beginning with a school-wide emphasis on Responsible Decision-Making, Self-Management and Self-Awareness, students are introduced to the concept of Self-Efficacy. To further develop students' leadership potential, we have the Student Leadersâ€™ Preparation Programme, where Secondary Two students are selected to reinforce the attributes of a Servant Leader in preparation for their leadership roles in Secondary 3 in their classes, student council and CCAs.</p>

<p align="justify">
Our AHS Student Councillors and CCA Leaders, guided by the principle of Servant Leadership, would embark on a leadership journey of serving others, so that those they serve may in turn be inspired to serve others.</p>

<p align="justify">
Our Student Leaders have indeed contributed immensely to the well-being of their peers in school and we are proud of our student leaders who continually strive towards excellence in serving others.</p>

"The leadership journey I embarked on was truly an enriching experience that ignited my personal growth. It has fostered my empathy and unwavering compassion for others. Through these experiences and opportunities, I gained a deeper understanding of Servant Leadership and the responsibility that comes with being a leader. Over the years, serving others has honed my ability to think holistically and be more proactive in serving the AHS family." </p>

"Through my leadership experience in AHS, I have developed into a leader who prioritises serving others and making a positive impact. This transformation is the result of the opportunities given to me that allowed me to step out of my comfort zone and embrace challenges. As a CCA Leader, I have learned the importance of humility, empathy and other-centredness in leadership." </p>
