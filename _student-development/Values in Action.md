AHS Cares is a concerted school effort to contribute to the community. Students plan and execute community projects by a model advocating the process of ‘Awareness-Action-Actualisation-Advocacy’.

Secondary 1 students choose their target communities and raise “awareness” about the communities. In Secondary 2, they translate their ideas into “action” using the Design Thinking approach that generate useful prototypes for the target communities. In Secondary 3, students undergo a Service Learning Project with their peers, “advocating” and “actualising” ideas that benefit the target communities and continue to inspire their juniors buy showcasing their work at the annual VIA Fair in Secondary 4.

The cohort experiences bring students out to the community, to distribute CNY couplet and organize a recycling project in Fengshan and Simei. The pandemic did not stop our students from contributing to the community. Our student leaders ran a campaign to bring cheer to the frontline workers, and the school wrote encouragement cards to our migrant workers.

Through these programmes, students learn about the diverse needs of different communities and how best to make a positive impact and create value for others.


### Bringing Cheer to Frontline Workers
The exercise to mobilize the school to get supplies to bring cheer to the frontline workers was a very meaningful experience and I am glad to able to contribute to the society during the pandemic through this project. Chang Xin Yi, 4C

Though the preparation and coordination stage was initially quite tough, but it really struck me to see how the organising team came together quickly and supported each other actively, whether in publicity or designing the stickers and cards, to put together the appreciation boxes for the frontline workers in the shortest time possible. Cadee Lu Xue’Er, 4A

### Working with Special Needs Community
The time I spent at the MOE-OBS Inclusive Sailing programme allowed me to learn how to step out of my comfort zone, interact with others who are different from me and explore the definition of being a leader. Mabel Lim Zhi Yi, 4J

Through Play Inclusive activity, I changed my perspective on people with disabilities as they have similar interests, hobbies and behaviours like us and are also very kind and compassionate. It was really an enjoyable and memorable time with them. Darren Chua Ming Zhe, 4E

### Service Learning & Future Problem-Solving Projects
Planning for carnival at Bedok Town Square for the Friendly Faces, Lively Place Challenge was a very enriching experience as we learnt how to organise a community activity and learnt how to communicate effectively with both my teammates and the public. We also enjoyed ourselves in the process as we got to work with our friends and made new friends at the same time! Ng Jie Lyn, 4B, Ng Jie Qi, 4C

The RSS-AHS combined camp that my team and I planned for offered me new perspectives and prompted me to communicate my ideas more effectively to others. Isaac Wan Zi Heng, 4K
