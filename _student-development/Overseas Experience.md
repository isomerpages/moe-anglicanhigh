#### Global Classroom 
<p align="justify">
At AHS, we believe that an overseas learning experience will allow our students to be global citizens who are confident in communicating with people from different cultures and backgrounds. They will also learn about the global and cultural perspectives that impact the environmental, social, cultural, political, and economic relations between countries.</p>

Our signature overseas programmes are:
* China Immersion Programme
* The Australian Connection
* Twinning school, Malaysia
* Overseas service learning projects

##### The Australian Connection
<p align="justify">
Our partner school is Wollondilly Anglican College, a premier school in New South Wales, Australia. This year, our students had an enriching Australian Connection from 24 May to 2 June 2023. Teachers and students were immensely enriched in the different domains of their Cultural Quotients via cultural tours to the Sydney Zoo, Sydney Opera House, Art Galleries, Nature Trails, Beach Walks and the school experience. </p>

<p align="justify">
Our students made new friends as they collaborated with their peers at Wollondilly Anglican College on Future Problem-Solving Projects, and engaged in intellectually challenging debates witth them during the nightly Contemporary Issues Forum. They broke the ice with a cultural sharing on Singapore, and bonded over activities such as dance lessons and the learning journey to Symbio Wildlife Park. This allowed our students to not only learn more about the Australian culture, but also be ambassadors of AHS and Singapore.</p>

<p align="justify">
Subsequently, we had the privilege and honour to host our friends from Wollondilly Anglican College (WAC) who visited us from 29th June to 6th July 2023, where our students and teachers had a fulfilling week interacting with them.</p>
<p align="justify">
From taking them on cultural trails planned by our students, to showing them around AHS, and working on their future-problem solving projects together, the students definitely bonded more and grew closer to each other.</p>
<p align="justify">
The students visited many tourist attractions such as Haji Lane, and Gardens by the Bay. Wollondilly's talented students even performed a dance to an Australian song and two musical pieces during our morning assembly. Our students also joined them in dancing and singing to "Home Among the Gumtrees", which they learnt during their visit to WAC in June this year.</p>

##### Twinning Programme with Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar (English) College, Johor Bahru, Malaysia
  
**25 July 2019**
<p align="justify">
It was an opportunity for the Secondary Three students in the Malay Special Programme (MSP) to experience various aspects of culture of our twinning school across the border in Johor, Malaysia. Students were immersed in the classroom setting at MSAB and had the chance to experience how lessons were conducted and see the differences and similarities between both schools. This programme also provided a platform for them to practise their conversations in the Malay language with their buddies.</p>

<p align="justify">
A Cultural Enrichment Programme was also organised for Secondary Two cohort to be exposed to elements of the Malay culture which are topics covered in the Conversational Malay syllabus. Students played the Kompang (a handheld drum commonly used in wedding festivities), painted on a pre-waxed cloth with Batik designs and tried the basic techniques of Silat (martial arts practised in Malay archipelago).</p>

“I think such programmes are necessary and important as people from both sides can get to understand their counterpart’s cultures and traditions, so as to not have any tensions between the two countries. This programme is one of many ways to understand life on the other side of the border.” – Chan Hui Si, 3K</p>

<p align="justify">
“Twinning programmes with overseas schools provide students like myself with an opportunity to study in a different country and environment, experiencing the history and culture of another country, as well as meeting new friends to enrich their personal development. International exchange programs are also effective to challenge students to develop a global perspective.” – Tan Yih Hao, 3J</p>

<p>“I think such programmes are beneficial and necessary as they allow for cultural exchange and understanding of one another, which I personally feel is very important in today's political climate.” – Joshua Tan Kai, 3E</p>
				
##### Overseas Community Involvement Project
      
**November 2019**
<p align="justify">
Every year, selected student leaders have the opportunity to go to Chiang Mai, Thailand, for an enriching leadership experience on the Overseas Community Involvement Project.</p>

<p align="justify">
As part of the Servant Leadership programme, these student leaders collaborate with the locals to provide a service to the villagers. As they work on the tasks for the village, they would need to adapt quickly to an unfamiliar environment while looking out for one another and ensuring each other's safety and well-being.</p>

"I felt that the interaction with the kindergarten children was truly memorable. Through skits in Chinese, I was able to engage and empathise with the children in my class. Mural painting was another meaningful activity which not only added colour to their lives but also helped us give back to the community. OCIP provided me with a unique and enriching platform to expand my views of the world, forcing me to step out of my comfort zone to experience a different way of life." Leong En Hao, 4D 2020</p>
 
<p align="justify">
"I clearly remember the road-paving activity. The whole process required much coordination and teamwork from everybody. Despite feeling tired and sore, I reminded myself to persevere.  Other-centredness was one leadership quality that I learnt from OCIP. There were numerous times when teammates placed others before themselves as they empathised with those who felt tired or worn out from the activities that they were engaged in.  Through this activity, I have learnt to take the initiative to help others when they need it, and do the right thing for others." Joseph Wee, 4F 2020</p>
