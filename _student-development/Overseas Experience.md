#### The AHS Global Classroom 环球课室 
<p align="justify">
The AHS Global Classroom consists of the Australian Connection (GC-AAC) and Chinese Immersion Programme (GC-CIP), both designed to enhance global literacy through strategic partnerships with schools in Australia, China, and Taiwan.
Students in the GC-AAC visited Wollondilly Anglican College (WAC) in Wollongong and Sydney, while those in the GC-CIP visited Loujiang Experimental Middle School (LEMS) in Suzhou, Shanghai, and Taipei Municipal Dunhua Junior High School (DJH) in Taipei.
Both groups focused on cultural exchange, cross-cultural communication, and critical thinking through a 'Future Problem-Solving (FPS) project with Cultural Intelligence' model. They discussed contemporary issues across countries, gaining confidence in articulating diverse perspectives. Our students also hosted their partner schools’ students in Singapore, sharing cultural insights through collaborative activities.

圣中环球课室包括澳大利亚和中华浸濡活动。为培养具有全球视野且自信的领导者，我校继续与澳大利亚的Wollondilly Anglican College和中国苏州省昆山市的娄江实验中学保持合作关系，同时欢迎新伙伴台北市立敦化国中的加入。

今年参加中华浸濡活动的学生有机会前往苏州、上海或台湾，深入了解当地文化，体验跨文化交流与差异。他们还在中国和台湾伙伴访问新加坡时接待了他们，通过分享会和策划的文化之旅，加深了对本地的了解， 拓宽了视野。

此外，学生们不仅设计并主持了破冰游戏，还与海外学伴共同完成了FPS畅想未来专案。在这个过程中，他们走出舒适圈，与新伙伴辩论、分享并共同探讨问题的解决之道，增进了对时事课题的理解，不仅重塑了观点，还增强了自信心，同时培养了批判性与设计思维能力。

##### The Australian Connection
<p align="justify">
Our unforgettable adventure in Australia was filled with breathtaking landscapes and warm hospitality. We formed lasting friendships with peers from Wollondilly Anglican College and felt right at home, especially during a game of handball! The GC-AAC programme gave us the opportunity to explore cultural diversity and gain insight into Australian perspectives. Collaborating on the FPS project allowed us to tackle real-world challenges together. This trip enhanced our independence, social skills, and our sense of how we can make a difference as youth!

##### 中华文化浸濡：苏州上海
<p align="justify">
参加环球课室不仅提升了我们的跨文化交流能力，还加深了我们对中新两国在社会、文化、历史和经济方面的理解，并培养了批判性思维。在交流中，我们深刻认识到本地文化的独特魅力，也意识到我们的文化同样迷人。

此外，通过担任组长、传统游戏统筹者、导览员等角色，我们在实践中学会了如何有效组织与协调活动，提升了领导力、团队精神和沟通技巧。我们希望能激励全校师生共同成长为具备全球视野的公民！

##### Twinning Programme with Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar (English) College, Johor Bahru, Malaysia
  
**25 July 2019**
<p align="justify">
It was an opportunity for the Secondary Three students in the Malay Special Programme (MSP) to experience various aspects of culture of our twinning school across the border in Johor, Malaysia. Students were immersed in the classroom setting at MSAB and had the chance to experience how lessons were conducted and see the differences and similarities between both schools. This programme also provided a platform for them to practise their conversations in the Malay language with their buddies.</p>

<p align="justify">
A Cultural Enrichment Programme was also organised for Secondary Two cohort to be exposed to elements of the Malay culture which are topics covered in the Conversational Malay syllabus. Students played the Kompang (a handheld drum commonly used in wedding festivities), painted on a pre-waxed cloth with Batik designs and tried the basic techniques of Silat (martial arts practised in Malay archipelago).</p>

<p align="justify">
“I think such programmes are necessary and important as people from both sides can get to understand their counterpart’s cultures and traditions, so as to not have any tensions between the two countries. This programme is one of many ways to understand life on the other side of the border.” – Chan Hui Si, 3K</p>

<p align="justify">
“Twinning programmes with overseas schools provide students like myself with an opportunity to study in a different country and environment, experiencing the history and culture of another country, as well as meeting new friends to enrich their personal development. International exchange programs are also effective to challenge students to develop a global perspective.” – Tan Yih Hao, 3J</p>

<p>“I think such programmes are beneficial and necessary as they allow for cultural exchange and understanding of one another, which I personally feel is very important in today's political climate.” – Joshua Tan Kai, 3E</p>
				
##### Overseas Community Involvement Project
      
**November 2019**
<p align="justify">
Every year, selected student leaders have the opportunity to go to Chiang Mai, Thailand, for an enriching leadership experience on the Overseas Community Involvement Project.</p>

<p align="justify">
As part of the Servant Leadership programme, these student leaders collaborate with the locals to provide a service to the villagers. As they work on the tasks for the village, they would need to adapt quickly to an unfamiliar environment while looking out for one another and ensuring each other's safety and well-being.</p>

<p align="justify">
"I felt that the interaction with the kindergarten children was truly memorable. Through skits in Chinese, I was able to engage and empathise with the children in my class. Mural painting was another meaningful activity which not only added colour to their lives but also helped us give back to the community. OCIP provided me with a unique and enriching platform to expand my views of the world, forcing me to step out of my comfort zone to experience a different way of life." Leong En Hao, 4D 2020</p>
 
<p align="justify">
"I clearly remember the road-paving activity. The whole process required much coordination and teamwork from everybody. Despite feeling tired and sore, I reminded myself to persevere.  Other-centredness was one leadership quality that I learnt from OCIP. There were numerous times when teammates placed others before themselves as they empathised with those who felt tired or worn out from the activities that they were engaged in.  Through this activity, I have learnt to take the initiative to help others when they need it, and do the right thing for others." Joseph Wee, 4F 2020</p>
