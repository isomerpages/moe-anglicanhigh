In Girl Guides, we believe that sisterhood brings us together, connecting like-minded girls hailing from various backgrounds. We partake in various activities to uphold our motto, “Be Prepared”, which serves as the cornerstone of our collective journey. Activities such as first aid courses, camps, and outdoor cooking help to enhance our practical skills, as well as teach us important values that permeate every aspect of our lives such as perseverance and confidence.</p>

With the mindset to always give our all, Anglican High Girl Guides has been able to achieve various awards. One worth mentioning is the Puan Noor Aishah Award (Gold), the highest recognition a Girl Guides Company can attain. During the annual East Division Day celebrations, our Guides have excelled in the areas of cheerleading, dancing, and drawing.</p>

In Girl Guides, young girls evolve into strong women. We foster friendships that last even after our time as a Guide.</p>

<i>Through the Mental Health Advocacy Programme organised by Girl Guides HQ, I had the opportunity to interact with professionals as well as students from other schools to learn more about the importance of mental health. This inspired my fellow Guides and me to kickstart our own Mental Health Social Action Project where we educated our friends on how to better take care of their mental well-being. It helped me to be more self-aware and be more equipped to look out for others around me. I am extremely grateful for this experience!</i></p>
