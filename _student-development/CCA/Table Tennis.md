“Through competition, I have learnt that winning is not everything; it’s about gaining experiences. Failure helps me to improve and grow to be a better player.” – Poh Xiu Wen (4K)

  

“Sometimes happiness doesn’t need words, just the sound of the ball.” – Glen Han (4C)

  

The Anglican High School Table Tennis Team has always been an important niche area of the school as it has consistently gained recognition at both Zonal and National levels.

  

Under the patient guidance and support of our coaches, as well as the teachers in charge, it is without doubt that our paddlers will continue to strive on for better results and uphold the honour and glory of our school.
