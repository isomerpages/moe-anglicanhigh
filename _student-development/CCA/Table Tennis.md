<i>During the last singles match for the B division boys’ 3rd/4th placing in the East Zone NSG 2023, the esprit de corps of team AHS was unforgettable. Everyone was cheering our last singles player on from the sidelines. Whether it was a point scored or a point lost, we gave him our utmost support. In the end, we managed to secure a hard-earned victory. Through this experience, we have indeed grown and emerged stronger together as a team.</i></p>
