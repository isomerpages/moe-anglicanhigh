“Throughout the 4 years, I have learnt that to achieve our goals, patience, hard work and focus are essential. As a team sport, every player is important in one way or another.” – FERRERA EUGIMIEL BAYOT, 4H

  

“Being in the basketball team has allowed me to learn about loyalty. All team members experience the ups and downs of a tournament together, and as we help each other along to take on the challenges, we can move forward together as one.” – POH ANNIE, 4K

  

Both our Basketball Boys and Girls teams are consistently one of the top teams and have won many championships for over 30 years.

  

In recent history, our 'C' Girls were East Zone Champions in 2016, 2017 and 2018, also coming in 2nd in the Nationals in 2018 as well. Our B Girls were champions in 2018. Our B Boys finished in 2nd in two tight finals in 2017 and 2018, while our C Boys fought their way to 3rd place in 2018.

  

AHS Basketball has high aspirations for our players. We constantly strive to seek a good balance between character development, academic excellence and sporting achievements.
