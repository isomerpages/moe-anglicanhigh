AHS Basketball has a rich tradition of sporting excellence since 1983. AHS was then under the leadership of Mr Moo Soon Chong (AHS Principal, 1983 â€“ 2001), who went on to start the Singapore Sports School. In 2006, AHS was awarded the East Zone Centre of Excellence for Sports, a testament to our commitment towards excellence in sports.</p>

Developing all-rounded student-athletes remains the very core of our sports culture in AHS. AHS Basketball has high aspirations for our players. We constantly strive to seek a good balance between character development, academic excellence and sporting achievements.</p>

<i>The support from the AHS family ensured that I did not give up during tough times. Instead, I learned to find a way to solve the problem and not hide from it. This has made me a more resilient person as a whole, both on and off the court. Not only that, persevering alongside my teammates has allowed us to push through the difficulties we faced, in order to achieve our common goal.</i></p>
