<i>Our experiences nurtured a sense of resilience within the team, accepting defeat and reminding us to stay humble in victory at the same time. Success doesn’t come without failure, and armed with a fighting spirit, we allow failure to propel us to work harder and polish our skills. I realised that victories are earned by the whole team and not individual players. Beyond the games and scores, the season taught me that leadership is all about empathy and resilience. It is about understanding individual strengths, fostering a supportive environment, and continuously learning and adapting. I am grateful for this leadership opportunity given to me, which has shaped me into a better team player. This season has certainly been a memorable one.</i></p>
