It has been a challenging and fruitful year once again for the AHS Badminton teams. While learning to manage the time between academic responsibilities and juggling Badminton training at the same time, our players have achieved remarkable results.

The Badminton team endeavours to bring more glory to the school and commits to always giving the best in every match. It has indeed been a rewarding year and we are raring to soar to even greater heights in the future.
