“Being in Badminton has helped us to understand the importance of teamwork. Through hard work and perseverance lead the road to success.” Song Renxu 3A  

“Being in badminton has allowed us to improve our skills and gain more experience. We have become better players and learned the importance of cooperation within the team.” Lim Wei 3K  

It has been a challenging and fruitful year once again for the AHS Badminton teams. While learning to manage the time between academic responsibilities and juggling Badminton training at the same time, our players have achieved remarkable results.

The Badminton team endeavours to bring more glory to the school and commits to always giving the best in every match. It has indeed been a rewarding year and we are raring to soar to even greater heights in the future.
