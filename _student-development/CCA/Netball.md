No matter the weather

No matter the pain

We do it all just for the game

To netball we say nothing but praise

For the game is life and life is pain

  

United as one, we stand tall

We get up after every fall

We laugh together we cry together

And a team like this lasts forever

For teamwork is the dreamwork

So just remember

Success is found when teamwork is around

Team Anglican aims towards excellence through discipline and commitment. Our netball girls believe in giving their best for each training session to achieve a high level of competency and as a team, they strive to develop a strong spirit of camaraderie.

  

Trainings are conducted three times a week. Each session is carefully planned to incorporate physical conditioning, mental strength, technical development of players and team dynamics. These trainings also instill a strong sense of responsibility and discipline in time management and behaviour of our netballers.

  

Intensive training sessions during the school holidays are also carried out to ensure that our netballers have ongoing training and bonding which are fundamental to a team sport.
