No matter the weather<br>
No matter the pain<br>
We do it all just for the game<br>
To netball we say nothing but praise<br>
For the game is life and life is pain<br>
United as one, we stand tall<br>
We get up after every fall<br>
We laugh together we cry together<br>
And a team like this lasts forever<br>
For teamwork is the dreamwork<br>
So just remember<br>
Success is found when teamwork is around<br>

Team Anglican aims towards excellence through discipline and commitment. Our netball girls believe in giving their best for each training session to achieve a high level of competency and as a team, they strive to develop a strong spirit of camaraderie.

Trainings are conducted three times a week. Each session is carefully planned to incorporate physical conditioning, mental strength, technical development of players and team dynamics. These trainings also instill a strong sense of responsibility and discipline in time management and behaviour of our netballers.

Intensive training sessions during the school holidays are also carried out to ensure that our netballers have ongoing training and bonding which are fundamental to a team sport.
