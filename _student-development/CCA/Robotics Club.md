AHS Robotics Club, where innovation comes to life through the exciting world of LEGO and a touch of Arduino magic!</p>
<p align="justify">
In this dynamic and hands-on environment, students not only build robots but also cultivate creativity, tenacity, and teamwork. Members get to showcase their abilities at the annual IDE Series Competition and World Robot Olympiad (WRO). Through the challenges of constructing intricate LEGO structures and elaborate programming, members learn to think critically, problem-solve, and collaborate effectively.</p>
<p align="justify">
Our club is not just about assembling and programming robots; it's a journey that inspires a passion for technology, fosters perseverance, and encourages the development of crucial skills that extend beyond the realm of robotics.</p>

<i>Through a combination of building and programming in our CCA, we have developed critical thinking skills and problem-solving skills as we work towards our goals. Friendships are built as we work in our groups on collective tasks, collaborating with people with different skill sets and abilities. The Robotics Club has created a safe environment for members to showcase their wit and skills in robotics. Within the time constraints of competitions, members have to work hard and tirelessly on their missions, thinking about how to accomplish them in the best way while programming and building their robots. Indeed, teamwork and collaboration are of paramount importance in all our endeavours.</i></p>
