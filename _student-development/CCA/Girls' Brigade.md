Welcome to AHS Girls’ Brigade, where we learn important life skills, forge friendships for life, and make a positive difference to our community!</p>
<p align="justify">
Formed in 2003, with our motto as “Every Girl a Leader, Every Officer a Servant Leader”, the aim is for every girl to grow into a dependable, disciplined, and dedicated member of the Brigade, who will make worthwhile contributions to the school and society.</p>
<p align="justify">
Our girls enjoy a variety of activities to develop the spiritual, physical, educational, and social facets of life. This includes leadership conferences, meaningful community/volunteer events, and thrilling hikes and camps, some of which are held as combined events with the Boys’ Brigade.</p>
<p align="justify">
Above all, our girls learn to develop empathy and the importance of creating value for others. Our hope is for each and every one of them to be mature individuals who desire to serve and lead in the communities God places them in.</p>

<i>Being in the Girls’ Brigade (GB) has enabled me to create value for others through many different experiences. The GB Friend in Deed project, which helps vulnerable Singaporeans by fulfilling their specific needs, was especially meaningful to me. I realised that not everyone is as fortunate as us, and we should take this opportunity to do whatever we can to help. I also learnt that we should have an open mind and heart to give. In my capacity as Company Leader, I learnt that creating a culture of respect, guiding, and caring for my juniors is as important as instilling discipline in them. Our weekly Friday devotion teaches us many values and reminds us of the purpose of our role as GB members - to serve others and God. GB has made a huge impact on me, and I will continue to create value for others.</i></p>
