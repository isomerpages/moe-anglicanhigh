Through a list of comprehensive and fun-filled programs such as first aid courses, drills, camps and outdoor activities, the CCA aims to develop cadets into independent young adults, who are capable of serving the public and the nation using their skills and first aid knowledge. These enriching programs will also be a great help towards their character development, uncover their strength and leadership potential while instilling lifelong values.</p>

AHSJB has been scaling greater heights and improving our first aid skills so as to serve the Nation and our school better. Our cadets will have interactive and enjoyable courses, allowing the Corps to foster strong bonding. Aspiring towards our motto - For the Service of Mankind, our cadets are actively involved in public duties, walkathons, flag days, as well as hospital duties to bridge the gaps between the community and their medical needs.</p>

<i>Being a member of SJB has provided me with an opportunity to grow as a servant leader. I first made contact with servant leadership during BNCO when I was introduced to various leadership styles. I then chose to lead by serving others. I committed myself to the growth of my juniors, which is one of the pillars of servant leadership. As such, during CCA training sessions, I often exposed my juniors to new challenges, and based on my observations of how they overcame them, I would give them constructive feedback so that they could work on their areas of improvement. Through this, I have come to understand that servant leadership is not just about ‘serving’ others, but it is also about assisting with our cadets’ growth and development, inspiring them to become the next servant leaders.</i></p>
