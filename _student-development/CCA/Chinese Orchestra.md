<i>Even though the Chinese Orchestra is split into different sections, fellow members always work together to resolve problems, allowing us to forge lasting friendships. Members from different sections also often encourage one another and practice together, especially in the preparation for performances or SYF. This strengthens the ties among members and creates an enjoyable and fun environment for all.</i></p>
