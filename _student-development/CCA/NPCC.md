In NPCC, cadets undergo a variety of activities like crime prevention, crime scene investigation (CSI), road safety training, shooting, campcraft, footdrill and precision drill, etc.</p>

Besides the opportunity to represent AHS in the NDP, our cadets also have the opportunity to fire .22 revolvers to attain the Marksmanship badge. They also get to participate in shooting, drill and CSI competitions at NPCC HQ.</p>

The annual Adventure Camp at Pulau Ubin equips our cadets with basic survival, cooking, canoeing and rafting skills. Some enrichment programs include Air Pistol training, Kayaking, basic First Aid certification and OBS.</p>

Our cadets have served the community in crime-prevention campaigns and collaborated with charity organisations like YMCA and student care centers.</p>

<i>A moment that had a significant impact on me would be the Unit Camp 2023. It was my first taste of leadership and I didnâ€™t know how to do a lot of things. There were many things I did wrong and things I could have done better. Nevertheless, I learned from them and made the camp enjoyable to the best of my abilities. All the mistakes made and lessons learnt while managing the camp are priceless experiences that have shaped me as a leader.</i></p>
