AHS Modern Dance emerges as a vibrant and dynamic CCA that not only promotes physical well-being but also fosters creativity, teamwork and self-expression.</p>
<p align="justify">
Our dancers learn to think outside the box, experiment with movements and express their emotions through the language of dance. This fosters a sense of individuality and encourages students to embrace their creative instincts. Our CCA programme also emphasises the importance of teamwork and collaboration. Group performances require synchronisation, coordination and a shared commitment to creating a cohesive and visually appealing routine. The collaborative nature of dance instils valuable life skills, teaching participants the significance of working together to achieve a common goal.</p>

The journey of AHS Modern Dance is studded with achievements and accolades that speak to the dedication and talent of its members. Whether winning competitions or captivating audiences at events, the AHS Modern Dance has left an indelible mark on the dance landscape.</p>

<i>In Modern Dance, there is only “us”. In order to achieve a common goal, dancers are provided with an environment, where we are comfortable to go above and beyond to help one another, embodying team spirit. This has enabled my team members and me to improve collectively and perform a perfect piece to the best of our abilities. We tide through difficulties together during performances and training, sharing fond memories and forging friendships. Through learning from one another, we are able to develop strong trust and create deeper connections as a community of dancers, staying united in facing any challenges that may come our way!</i></p>
