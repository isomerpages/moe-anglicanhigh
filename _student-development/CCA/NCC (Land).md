AHS NCC is a high spirited and dynamic CCA with strong camaraderie among its cadets. Known for its military regimentation, its cadet leaders emphasize on safety during training as its top priority. There will be HQ-initiated activities like Camp Forge and Camp Steel. Precision Drill Squad (PDS) and Free-Style Drill (FSD) are taught in a rigorous and intensive manner.</p>
<p align="justify">
As there are competitions to participate in, cadets will be trained under the care of certified cadet leaders. Seniors acting as instructors always assess the meeting of realistic training objectives under the advice of teacher-officers.</p>

Orienteering skills are taught for navigation purposes. Real weapon shooting culminates after passing all tests on weapon handling. Prior to this, training using digital simulations and air-rifles are usually conducted. In AHS NCC, cadets are never short of opportunities to hone leadership skills and confidence.</p>

<i>The Sec 3 Part C Bonding Camp has impacted me a lot as I learnt how to be a better leader. Throughout the camp, I learnt more about the importance of teamwork, and the role it plays when leading others. I had to be confident and think outside the box in order to resolve certain challenges and hurdles that surfaced. It felt challenging at times and sometimes I felt like giving up. However, it was all worth it upon seeing my friends having fun as they participated in the many activities we planned. This experience has definitely allowed me to hone my leadership and planning skills.</i></p>
