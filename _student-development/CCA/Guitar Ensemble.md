“Participating in the SYF provided me with a platform to express my love and feelings through music while being able to share them with others.” – by Wong Jia Xi, 4G

“There’s immense power when everyone comes together as one, and we would not be able to achieve our desired results without the contribution of every member, and I’m thankful to be part of this fruitful journey.” – by Celest Neo Zi Xuan, 3J


The AHS Guitar Ensemble aims to develop young guitarists and hone their skills in playing the instrument by providing our members opportunities to participate in different public or school base performances. These will help to built the confidence of our members and hopefully discover their talents to let it soar. We also encourage our members to compete in the SYF (Singapore Youth Festival) Central Judging held alternate years.
