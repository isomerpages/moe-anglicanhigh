The Anglican High School Infocomm Club is the ideal place for students who show interest in digital photography and have an inclination for learning useful IT skills. Members are taught the craft of taking good photographs, using up-to-date camera equipment. They are then given opportunities to put their skills to good use by providing photo coverage for important school events such as Chinese New Year celebrations, Foundersâ€™ Day, National Day celebrations, to name a few.</p>
<p align="justify">
They also provide photography and videography support to cover a broad spectrum of school activities such as sports competitions, uniformed group training, stage performances and day-to-day school programmes, thus helping to provide a record of our vibrant school life. CCA Outings are organised once every semester for members to hone their skills further on interesting subjects outside the school campus.</p>
<p align="justify">
Members also pick up useful IT skills such as coding to enrich their repertoire of knowledge to be future ready for a technology-driven world.</p>

<i>Our trip to Haji Lane has trained me to be more responsible as I was assigned to be a group leader. It also exposed me to a different type of photography and gave me the chance to connect with my juniors. I feel that this outing has not only allowed us to hone our skills, but also created stronger bonds within the CCA. I look forward to participating in more of such activities in the future!</i></p>
