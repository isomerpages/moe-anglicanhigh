“Debating and Public Speaking has allowed me to enhance my growth as an individual, to stand up for what I believe in, and also opened my eyes to many of the issues in the world today.” – Daphne Tan, 3H

  

“ Being in Debating and Public Speaking has allowed me to have a deep understanding of global issues, and taught me to speak up for what is right.” – Koh Ding Xuan, 3F

  

  

In alignment with the school's vision to nurture bicultural scholars with strong language competencies and communication skills, the Debating and Public Speaking was formed as an interest group in 2012. Enthusiastic students who already had one CCA attended both their main CCA as well as debate training at Speakers' Club. In recognition of their dedication and the growing interest in the interest group, the school set up Speakers' Club as a new CCA in 2013.

  

The club has experienced a dynamic journey, with the hunger, hard work and humility of its pioneer members, moving from a Division III to Division II school in 2016, due to its excellent performance in the Singapore Secondary Schools Debating Championships in 2015.

  

Besides participating in debate competitions and Model United Nations, Debating and Public Speaking also helms the MAAN show broadcasted from Studio Arden every Friday from 2.15pm to 2.45pm. The show engages the audience in light-hearted topics from social trends and school events to music and songs the student body enjoys.
