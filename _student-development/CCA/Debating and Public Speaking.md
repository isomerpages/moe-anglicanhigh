In alignment with the school’s vision to nurture students with strong language competencies and communication skills, the Debating and Public Speaking (DPS) Club was formed as an interest group in 2012, and became a formal CCA in 2013. </p>
<p align="justify">
The club has experienced a dynamic journey, fuelled by the drive and humility of its pioneer members, progressing from a Division III to Division I School Team.  This is due to its excellent performance in the Singapore Secondary Schools Debating Championships, and it has maintained this status for the past five years and counting.</p>
<p align="justify">
Besides participating in debate competitions and Model United Nations, members have taken part in public speaking competitions such as PESA (Plain English Speaking Award) and NPSC (National Public Speaking Competition).  The club also broadcasts from Studio Arden every Friday from 1.45pm to 2.15pm.  This song/music programme serves as a public speaking platform for club members, allowing them to leverage their ability to articulate themselves and be creative in their expression. </p>

<i>Involvement in several Debate competitions has provided me with ample opportunities to explore, try and fail. Through these, I have seen how each decision I made led to different results – successes and failures. The competitions have taught me, beyond valuing my own growth, to respect the hard work of others. I better understand the importance of thinking critically, especially where my actions can impact others and vice versa. I am extremely grateful to have been given the chance to participate in these competitions as they have allowed me to grow as a person and to be able to think more analytically.</i></p>
