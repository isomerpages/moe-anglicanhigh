In Scouts, we believe in our motto, Be Prepared. 
<p align="justify">
As such, we nurture leaders who serve the community by participating actively in the 4 Core Scouting Competencies - Camping, Exploration, Cooking and Pioneering which will culminate in our Unit Scout Leadership Camp, where our Scouts display their leadership abilities and are stretched in terms of their mental and physical abilities. They learn to listen and give instructions confidently.</p>
<p align="justify">
Our Scouts also helm the annual AHS-RSS Camp where they do experiential learning to interact with younger charges in the RSS Cub Scout and Brownie Units. This experience allows them to learn responsible decision making and the importance of planning.</p>
<p align="justify">
Apart from the Core Scouting Competencies, our Scouts go through Outdoor Electives and certifications - in areas such as sport climbing, archery, kayaking and first aid.</p>
<p align="justify">
The Unit remains a premier choice in Anglican High School with consecutive Frank Cooper Sands Award (Gold) and many Chief Commissioner’s Award holders, a testament to the Scouts’ hard work and effort.</p>

<i>Being in the Scouts has benefitted me a lot, especially in my growth as a confident and resilient leader. I was tasked to handle many challenges, and the support and motivation of my batchmates and teachers encouraged me to persevere and not give up. Scouting also provided me a chance to step out of my comfort zone to lead and speak up, which has helped me become more confident as a person and leader.</i></p>
