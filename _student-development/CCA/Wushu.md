Explore the exciting world of Wushu, where sports and art come together! Our students go through a rigorous training program, learning skills for both the National Schools Games (NSG) and school performances.</p>
<p align="justify">
In pursuit of excellence, each student is encouraged to represent the school at the NSG for a minimum of two years, a commitment that not only contributes to their personal growth but also forms an integral part of our LEAP 2.0 grading system. This unique approach to grading emphasizes the holistic development of our students, recognizing the valuable lessons learned through active participation in Wushu.</p>

During competition season, the training intensity escalates to three days per week, providing students with an immersive preparation experience. This concentrated effort not only refines their techniques but also fosters a sense of camaraderie and teamwork among the participants.</p>

<i>I joined Wushu with no prior experience or background. Thus, it was difficult
for me at the beginning as I had many things to learn. I struggled to keep up with the rest of my CCA mates as all of them were much more experienced than I was. Although it was really tempting to give up, I persevered and worked on improving
myself. Though there is still much for me to learn, I have definitely improved from when I first started and I am proud of my progress. The experience of going out of my comfort zone to learn something new and having to start from scratch was definitely a humbling one. Having pressed on and overcoming difficulties to improve myself, I believe I have grown as a person.</i></p>
