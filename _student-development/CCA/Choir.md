Over the years, Anglican High School Choir has established itself as a beacon of musical excellence, captivating audiences with soul-stirring performances that transcend boundaries. From enchanting renditions of classical masterpieces to contemporary interpretations that resonate with modern sensibilities, our choir has consistently pushed the boundaries of artistic expression. With a commitment to precision and a passion for music that knows no bounds, the Anglican High School Choir has garnered accolades and applause at various competitions and Choral concerts such as Quispium Novus 2018 and Limelight 2023. Beyond the stage, our choir members embody teamwork, discipline, and a shared love for the transformative power of music. Under the guidance of their choral conductor, Mr Terrence Toh, the four-section choir (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass) continually seeks to break new ground in their pursuit of excellence. Join us on a journey through the notes and rhythms that define our legacy, and witness firsthand the extraordinary artistry that continues to make the Anglican High School Choir a source of pride for our school community.</p>

<i>With the hard work and strong commitment of our members, we are extremely happy to see our remarkable achievement in the Singapore Youth Festival, in which we achieved the Certificate of Distinction. It is impossible not to attribute our success to the unwavering perseverance and teamwork of our members. The countless hours of dedicated rehearsals have definitely helped in raising the standards of the choir. We are also grateful for the strong team spirit of the entire choir, which has helped us to deliver many spectacular and captivating performances. It is through these values that we have been able to overcome adversities and accomplish great things as a united choir in Anglican High. We are all truly proud to be a part of this wonderful batch and we are even more grateful to our teachers and our conductor who have supported us immensely in our endeavours.</i></p>
