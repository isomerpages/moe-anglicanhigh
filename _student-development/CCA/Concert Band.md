AHS Concert Band serves as a platform for music education and artistic expression while developing social skills for personal growth. Students are given opportunities to improve their proficiency in playing instruments, reading music scores and understanding music theory. </p>
<p align="justify">
Our studentsâ€™ participation in internal and external events such as the National Day Celebrations and Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation respectively, is a testament of their growth as performers in their time in the CCA. AHS Band successfully fosters a sense of camaraderie and a community of teachers, instructors, executive committee members and peers through events like Secondary One CCA Orientation programme, Band Bonding Day, external performances and Exchange programmes with other schools.</p>

Looking back at my Secondary One self, it struck me that my CCA has brought me to where I currently am, from a timid little girl who was too afraid to speak up to now, a leader in my CCA. I believe that my CCA has definitely served a vital role in shaping me into a better leader and person. It has enriched me with life lessons, values and skills, such as respect, perseverance, teamwork, and effective communication. One of the values I have learnt through my CCA is the humility to learn. Each person can only hold a finite amount of knowledge, with much more to discover and learn. Having the humility to learn has empowered me with the strength to embrace my weaknesses and grow to become a better version of myself every day. Additionally, it was only through my enriching CCA experiences that I found out what being a true leader is, enabling me to continue striving towards my goal of being a perfect servant leader.</i></p>
