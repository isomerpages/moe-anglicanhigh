In 2015, Anglican High School Concert Band was invited to perform for the first time on 16 Feb 2015 as part of a Limelight Series organized by the Esplanade. The concert band performed to a full house of audience, playing light-hearted audience favourite pieces like 'Mama Mia' and 'Mambo No. 5'. The percussion section also did a solo Funky Buckets item with recycled buckets. The performance was well-received by the audience and positive feedback was given.
The Concert Band also participated in the 2015 SYF Arts Presentation and through the hard work of teachers and students, we managed to achieve a Certificate of Accomplishment for all our efforts. For the second half of the year in 2015, many performances and showcases, such as the annual National Day celebrations, Teachers’ Day celebrations and the Secondary One recital, have also been put together by the band to increase their exposure in music making and making every band member a great musician. Indeed all this will not be possible without the support of our Principals, teachers, friends and families who provided us with great support and care from the preparation stage all the way up to the actual performance. To quote from Howard Cosell, a sports journalist, he had once said: “The ultimate victory in competition is derived from the inner satisfaction of knowing that you have done your best and that you have gotten the most out of what you had to give.” The Anglican High School Concert Band will continue to strive to do our best in all we do; to God be the glory.
