“Being a BB member has taught me values and skills that I can use in my day to day existence.” Wong Joe Young, 3G  

“Being a BB member has created a platform for me to interact and forge strong ties with my peers while learning various leadership skills. It has also helped me to grow closer to God and learn Christian values that I can apply in my daily life.”  Lim Tiong Keng Luke, 3J

The Boys’ Brigade 14th company is supported by All Saints’ Church English Congregation. The latter provides spiritual and pastoral support through the teaching of moral values from the Bible. The teachers-in-charge and the church work hand in hand to nurture good values and emotional resilience in the boys through the well-thought through and carefully-designed CCA programme. 

The company has been attaining at least a Silver award in the annual JM Fraser Award for Excellence in recent years. In the annual Adventure Quest competition comprising of more than 120 teams each year, it has also always been placed on the Gold Honour Roll. Each year, our top performing members are also awarded the Founders’ Award, the pinnacle award for boys in secondary schools.

The boys participate in varied and enriching CCA activities. The Kayaking and First Aid courses seek to equip them with important life skills. The boys also render their services to the less privileged through our BB Cares event and Share-A-Gift project. The annual Recruitment, Leadership Development and Company Orderly Sergeant camps that are organised in March, are also platforms of consolidation and evaluation of the camp craft learnt and present as opportunities for the boys to bond, learn and grow as one 14th Company.
