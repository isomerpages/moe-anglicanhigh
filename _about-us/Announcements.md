Congratulations! Your child/ward has been posted to Anglican High School. We look forward to partnering you as we embark on your child's/ward’s secondary education journey together.</p>

The Secondary One Registration process is entirely online. There is NO NEED to come to the school physically for registration. The designated primary contact of your child will receive a notification on Parents Gateway (PG) after 2.00pm on 21 December, Wednesday or an email from AHS if you have no access to PG. To complete the registration, please ACKNOWLEDGE the PG notification or reply to the email.</p>
