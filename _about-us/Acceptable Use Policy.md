<p><strong>Purpose of the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</strong>
</p>
<p>Technology is an essential part of learning in today’s world. This Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP) establishes guidelines on the appropriate use of EdTech
resources to help you understand how to use these resources safely and
responsibly, in line with efforts to develop your digital literacies and
growth as digitally responsible citizens.</p>
<p></p>
<p>EdTech resources include the following, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Learning devices (e.g. Personal Learning Devices (PLDs), school
devices)</p>
<p>-&nbsp;ICT system accounts (e.g. Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS),
iCON)</p>
<p>-&nbsp;School internet networks</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and applications</p>
<p>For more information, please refer to:</p>

</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>General</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should not attempt to access data,
system and information that you are not authorised to.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are reminded that the use of learning
devices and school’s EdTech resources should solely be for the purpose
of learning.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must comply with the age advisories
stated in the Terms of Service of any AI tools or applications you use.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Using your PLD</strong>
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are responsible for your PLD. In
the event of loss or theft of the device, you must make a police report
and report the matter to the school.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To have a positive learning experience,
you should ensure that your PLD is fully charged before bringing it to
school. No charging is allowed in school, as students are expected to fully
charge their devices at home.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are reminded to keep your PLD updated
by installing the relevant patches and updates when being prompted by the
system.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All PLDs are installed with a Device
Management Application (DMA) to support a safe and conducive learning environment.
You should not attempt to bypass the DMA.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are responsible for regularly backing
up your learning materials in your PLD to prevent data loss.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Being a Responsible Digital Citizen</strong>
</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should interact with others in a
respectful and responsible way. You should not post online remarks and/or
send messages that are</p>
<p>•&nbsp;racially and/or religiously insensitive,</p>
<p>•&nbsp;vulgar and/or offensive, or</p>
<p>•&nbsp;hurtful to others.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should not use any devices to</p>
<p>•&nbsp;store, modify, create or share content (e.g. documents, presentations,
pictures and videos) that is inappropriate (e.g. indecent, pornographic,
defamatory, AI-generated deepfakes, hurtful to self or others).</p>
<p>•&nbsp;make threats, cause harassment or embarrassment, impersonate or
intimidate others.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should not use MOE/school-deployed ICT system accounts
for any commercial activities (e.g. buying and selling of goods and services).</p>
<p>Non-compliance with the above will lead to disciplinary action in accordance
with the school’s discipline policy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Respecting Copyright</strong>
</p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are reminded to obtain explicit permission from the
content owner(s) before downloading, copying or sharing any copyrighted
materials (e.g. pictures, videos, music).</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should not use, copy, edit or share digital files
in an unauthorised or illegal manner.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp; When using AI tools to generate content, you should avoid
prompts that carry a high risk of infringing intellectual property rights.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Using Artificial Intelligence (AI)</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Age-Appropriate Use:</strong>
</p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp; You must ensure that you meet the minimum age requirement
specified in each AI tool's age restrictions before using it.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp; AI use must be developmentally appropriate for your level:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Secondary 1-2</strong>: You may use AI tools under teacher supervision
with gradual release for independent use. You must complete the Basic Module
on AI and AI-enabled Features in SLS as part of PDLP onboarding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secondary 3-4</strong>: You may use AI tools independently with
emphasis on maintaining your learning responsibility and avoiding over-reliance
on AI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Academic Integrity and Responsible Use:</strong>
</p>
<p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are to practise academic integrity and be responsible
for your own learning when using AI. You must not submit AI-generated responses
wholesale in place of your own work.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should use AI to support your learning (such as brainstorming,
refining drafts, checking language, providing feedback) rather than replacing
your own thinking and effort.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the use of AI is permitted for assignments, you must
acknowledge and cite the use of AI in assessments and homework as required
by your teachers. You must document your AI use by citing the AI tool used,
the prompts you used, and how the AI input influenced your work.</p>
<p><strong>Staying Safe and Secure Online</strong>
</p>
<p>20.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should report any incidents (e.g. unusual device behaviour
or inappropriate use of devices), to the school.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are reminded to develop online safety habits. This
includes:</p>
<p>§&nbsp; Not disclosing personal access credentials (e.g. MIMS password,
PLD passcode, etc.)</p>
<p>§&nbsp; Not sharing sensitive personal data (e.g. home address, passwords)
online or on AI platforms</p>
<p>§&nbsp; Verifying credibility of online content before sharing</p>
<p>§&nbsp; Avoiding clicking on suspicious links or downloading unknown files</p>
<p>§&nbsp; Being cautious when interacting with others online (e.g. on social
media) by not engaging with strangers</p>
<p>22.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should be aware that AI tools may provide inaccurate,
biased, or inappropriate responses and should always verify information
from multiple sources.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp;&nbsp; You must ensure that any data you input into AI tools
is appropriate and does not contain sensitive personal information about
yourself or others.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Safety and Well-being</strong>
</p>
<p>24.&nbsp;&nbsp; You must not rely on AI tools, chatbots, or AI companions
for social-emotional support, mental health conversations, or personal
counselling. Instead, seek help from trusted adults at home or in school
(e.g. School Counsellors, Teachers).</p>
<p>25.&nbsp;&nbsp; You must not develop emotional dependencies on AI tools
or treat them as substitutes for human relationships.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Digital Wellbeing and Balance</strong>
</p>
<p>26.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are reminded to balance screentime with other activities
including physical exercise and face-to-face social interactions.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should avoid excessive use of your devices outside
learning hours.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should take regular breaks to rest your eyes and mind.</p>
<p>29.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are reminded to practice good sleep hygiene by not
using your devices one hour before bedtime.</p>
<p>30.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should prioritise human interactions and relationships
over AI interactions for social and emotional support.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Reporting and Support</strong>
