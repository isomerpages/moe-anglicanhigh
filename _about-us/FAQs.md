**Q:	Do students taking Higher Chinese Language (HCL) have priority for admission to Anglican High School during posting?**

A: Students who obtained Distinction/Merit/Pass in HCL and a PSLE score of 14 or better (i.e. PSLE score ≤ 14) will be eligible for posting advantage when applying to SAP schools, such as Anglican High School.
If multiple students with the same PSLE score apply for places in the same SAP school, those with better HCL grades will be allocated a place ahead of other students. This applies before the tie-breakers for S1 posting.
