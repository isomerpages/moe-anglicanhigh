As we approach our 70th year of service to society, we are grateful to God for His many blessings to us as a vibrant learning community founded on traditional Chinese values and Christian beliefs.  Set up in 1956 by 5 Chinese speaking congregations of the Anglican Diocese in Singapore, the school has progressed over time to become a leading educational institution providing a quality brand of holistic education for all students passing through its gates. AHS is Singapore’s only Protestant SAP secondary school and this unique identity has indelibly shaped the ethos of the school positively over the years.</p>
