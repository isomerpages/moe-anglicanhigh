<b><u>AHS70: Celebrate with Gratitude</u></b><br>

<p align="justify">
As Anglican High School looks ahead to its 70th anniversary in 2026, we do so with hearts filled with gratitude. The theme we have chosen, “Celebrate with Gratitude,” aptly reflects both the significance of this milestone and the posture of thanksgiving with which we approach it. By God’s grace, the school has grown from strength to strength within Singapore’s education landscape, nurturing generations of young men and women of character. These are individuals shaped by Anglican High School’s distinctive holistic education—one that integrates traditional Chinese community-centred values with a strong Christian ethos of love, service, and excellence.</p>
<p align="justify">
The theme verses guiding us this year are taken from Isaiah 12:3–5. In this passage, the people of Judah offer thanksgiving to God for the promised coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, following a season of testing and challenge. As we reflect on these verses and their context, we find meaningful lessons for ourselves as a school community marking our 70th year. A deep attentiveness to God’s Word helps us to know and understand the God we serve, and to anchor ourselves in values that enable us to flourish in life.</p>
<p align="justify">
First, when we “Celebrate with Gratitude,” we do so not because life is without difficulty, but because we have received salvation through Jesus Christ. The people of Judah, having endured a period of trial, responded to God’s promise with thanksgiving and praise. Likewise, we rejoice in the grace and mercy shown to us through Christ, who has already come, giving us enduring hope. This assurance allows us to celebrate even amid challenges. Anglican High School, too, has experienced seasons of both joy and testing, yet we remain confident in the goodness of God in all circumstances. Through challenges, we grow in character and in faith, sustained by a God who loves and cares for us abundantly. This, indeed, is reason enough to celebrate.</p>
<p align="justify">
Second, we give thanks not only for God’s love and mercy, but also for the privilege of serving the community over the past seven decades. Established by the Anglican Diocese of Singapore to serve families in the Tanah Merah area, the school has remained faithful to its mission of providing quality education to the young. Over the years, Anglican High School has become known for bringing out the best in its students—academically, morally, and holistically. Our students are encouraged to strive not only for personal excellence, but also for the good of the community, reflecting the excellence of the God they serve. Many carry this spirit of service with them beyond graduation, contributing meaningfully to society. We remain committed to sustaining this virtuous cycle of blessing others. My staff and I count it a privilege to be part of the ongoing AHS story, just as generations of leaders, teachers, and staff have done before us. The legacy of Anglican High School is written one day at a time, and each of us plays an integral part in shaping it.</p>
<p align="justify">
Finally, our celebration of Anglican High School’s journey is not for self-glorification, but as a testimony to God’s faithfulness and care over the years. In Isaiah 12, the people are called to “make his works known among the nations.” The works of the Lord are not meant to be kept silent, but to be shared as encouragement to others who have yet to encounter Him. Truly, the story of Anglican High School is one of God’s blessing and favour, and all glory belongs to Him alone. Through the AHS70 commemorative events of 2026, we hope that the account of God’s goodness will be shared widely and warmly.</p>
<p align="justify">
As we “Celebrate with Gratitude,” may our hearts be encouraged and our praises resound. The journey towards holiness and righteousness is ongoing, yet it is through this journey that character is shaped and community is built. All glory be to God alone.</p>


<b><u>圣中七十：感恩欢庆</u></b><br>

<p align="justify">
2026年，圣公会中学即将迎来七十周年校庆，为此，我们心存感恩。此次校庆的主题 —— 感恩欢庆，不仅充分体现了这个里程碑的重大意义，也凸显了我们心中无限的感恩。蒙神的恩典，我校多年来立足于本地教育界，并茁壮成长，力上加力，培育出一代代品学兼优的莘莘学子。他们都深受圣中独有的全面教育的熏陶 —— 一个融合了以群体为中心的传统华族价值观与以爱、奉献、卓越为核心的基督教精神的教育理念。</p>
<p align="justify">
今年，我们的主题经文取自以赛亚书第十二章第三至五节。在这段经文中，犹大的子民在历经试炼后，为即将降生的弥赛亚，耶稣基督，向神献上感恩。随着我们步入圣中发展的第七十个年头，这段经文深具意义：我们要悉心聆听神的话语，好让我们深知我们侍奉的神，同时扎根于优良价值观，使生命发旺。</p>
<p align="justify">
首先，我们感恩欢庆，不是因为生活一帆风顺，而是因为我们因耶稣基督而得到救恩。犹大的子民在历经一段试炼后，以感恩与赞美回应神的应许。同样的，我们也因领受基督的恩典与怜悯而喜乐 —— 耶稣已降生，并赐予我们长存的盼望。这样满足的指望使我们就算在患难中也仍能欢庆。圣公会中学多年来也曾经历过各种喜乐与试炼，但我们仍凡事坚信神的恩惠。患难使我们的品格与信心得以成长，深深关爱我们的神必扶持我们。这的确足以让我们欢庆。</p>
<p align="justify">
其次，我们不仅因神的爱与怜悯而感恩，也为过去七十载能有幸奉献社区而感恩。圣公会新加坡教区当年在丹那美拉创立圣公会中学，旨在服务该区的居民。多年来，我们谨守这份使命，为无数青年提供优质教育。无论在学术、品德方面，乃至学生的全面发展，圣公会中学在激发学生潜能方面的表现有目共睹。我们鼓励每一位圣中学子不只追求个人的卓越表现，更要贡献社区，以彰显神的美德。许多校友毕业后仍秉持这份服侍的精神，积极贡献社会。我们将继续致力于推动这个造福人群的良性循环。如同历代的领导、老师们及其他职员，能够成为圣中不断演进的校史的一份子，是我与全体职员的荣幸。圣公会中学一步一脚印，正在逐日谱写其辉煌的事迹，而我们每一位都有份在其中留下一笔一划。</p>
<p align="justify">
最后，我们庆祝圣公会中学的成长之旅，不是为了自我荣耀，而是见证神多年来的信实与呵护。以赛亚书第十二章，神的子民要“将他所行的传扬在万民中”。神的作为不得隐蔽，而是要宣扬的，以激励还未经历神的人。的确，圣公会中学的故事充满神的祝福与恩惠 —— 一切荣耀归于神。借着2026年圣中七十的各项庆祝活动，我们希望神的恩惠广为流传，且为人所津津乐道。</p>
<p align="justify">
在我们“感恩欢庆”的当儿，愿我们的心深受激励、愿赞美声四起。这段迈向圣洁公义的旅程持续推进，唯有踏上这段旅程，我们才得以塑造品格、建设社群。一切荣耀归于神。</p>
