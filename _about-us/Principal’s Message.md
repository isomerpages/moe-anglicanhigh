### Our Students, Our Future
Anglican High School will be celebrating 65 years of excellence and the legacy in nurturing future leaders who are honourable and of fine character in 2021. Our strong heritage as an SAP school, mission institution of learning, strong alumni partnership, and rich bi-cultural heritage enable us to inculcate in our students a strong sense of pride in the school culture and ethos.

Many of our alumni have been very successful in their educational pursuits and careers.  I am extremely grateful for their continued ties and strong support for their alma mater, as they perform as positive role-models for our students. As our alumni make inroads in their contributions to society as compassionate servant leaders, it is our wish that every child who passes through our gates be inspired to soar and realise their potential: becoming future-ready citizens, conscious of their responsibilities to family, community and country.

### Nurturing the Leader in each AHS Student
We are privileged and encouraged that each year, we continue to receive and groom talented students to be tenacious fighters who exhibit the AHS spirit of indomitability. Every opportunity is seized to help our students grow and see possibilities in circumstances that would nurture them to be well-balanced individuals, equipped with the necessary skills to see them through life and maximise their potential.

It is with this in mind that we carried out a re-visioning process. We engaged our staff, parents, alumni and school management committee.  From scanning of current and future trends, and the profile and strengths of our students, we concluded that we have entered the next phase of growth, where ‘Every AHS Student A Leader – Leading Honourably , Learning for Life, and Creating Value for Others.  We believe our students will be leaders in whichever fields of career they choose.  As a leader, we want them to have an honourable character in the way they lead others, to have an attitude of learning so that they will continue to lead others to learn, and finally an aspiration to create value for others, and thus making a difference to their community and our country.

### Moving Towards Customised, Progressive, Holistic Learning
Many things are changing around us rapidly. We live in a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous world today, as witnessed from the impacts of COVID-19.  Crises create opportunities.  The fast pace of technological advancements in all aspects of our lives today means that we can tap on technology for customised and progressive learning. I am happy to share that we have had experience in engaging students’ learning using 1:1 digital devices since 2018.  We will be in good position for the implementation of Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) in 2021.  We envision our students to learn with technology and to learn technology to solve problems.

Technology is simply a tool for learning and problem-solving.  It is the mind that uses it.  My teachers and I are committed to equipping our students with critical and creative thinking skills through the Anglican Critical Thinking Skill (ACTS) and Design Thinking.  With these skills in thinking and technology, our students will be effective in creating value for others, thereby benefitting the community.  

Fundamentally, a well-balanced education is essential.  We endeavour to provide many platforms for students to demonstrate their leadership, character, passion for learning and love for the community. Opportunities will be created for students to pursue their interests and at the same time give back to the community. This will fulfil our aim of nurturing compassionate servant leaders and providing an environment conducive to our students acquiring the values of holiness, righteousness, respect, loyalty, responsibility and perseverance.

AHS students have proven that they have the enthusiasm, energy and verve to follow that rainbow and the talents and skills to ride the waves of the future.

# 校长寄语
### 我们的学生，我们的未来！
2021年，圣公会中学将迎来建校65周年的校庆。届时，我们将庆祝65年来圣中人在育人道路上不断追求卓越、努力培育正直的未来领袖而取得的种种成就。圣公会中学是一所特选中学，也是一所教会学校，同时还我们拥有一个强大的校友会，这样多元而深厚的双语双文化传统是我们宝贵的教育资源，我们借此把强烈的文化自豪感和圣中精神灌输给了一代又一代的圣中学子。

我们的许多校友在追求学业和事业发展上非常成功，同时他们也不忘支持母校，与母校保持着非常密切且持久的联系，对此我深怀感恩。这些学长们为在校及未来的圣中学子树立了良好榜样，他们都是满怀大爱与同情心的公仆领袖。愿每一个走出圣中校门的孩子都能受到这些优秀学长的感召和鼓舞，发挥才干、大展宏图，愿他们能肩负起自己对家国与社会的责任，成为一个为未来而生的好公民。

### 新的愿景：卓越领袖
更让我们深感荣幸与鼓舞的是，我们每年都能招收到许多才华横溢的学子。我们将一以贯之地以圣中精神教导他们，让他们成长为不屈不挠的人生斗士。我们不会放过每一个有益于圣中学子成长与发展的机会，为他们打造一个优良的教育环境，让他们看到人生的无限可能。我们会最大限度地发掘他们的潜能，传授他们未来所需之技能，让他们成为各方面均衡发展的杰出人才。

带着这样的责任与使命，我们重新规划了圣中的育人愿景。在这过程中，我们充分听取和参考了老师、家长、校友与校董会的意见。通过对当前与未来发展趋势的分析，同时结合圣中学长的特点与优势，我们认为圣中学长的成长与发展已经进入到了一个新的阶段。我们确信，在未来他们会在各自从事的领域成为领导性人才。身为领袖，他们当具有秉公行义的品格，他们当具有终身勤学的态度，他们当具有为他人创造价值，让社会与国家变得更美好的雄心壮志。于是，我们新的愿景产生了——卓越的领袖：秉公行义的品格，终身勤学的态度，共造福祉的心志。

### 与时俱进：个性化而渐进式的全面教育
今日之世界瞬息万变，我们身处在一个充满变数与未知的复杂时代，今年我们还不幸亲历了新冠病毒的冲击。但是，危机往往孕育着机遇：各种高新科技正在飞速发展并很快应用于我们生活的方方面面，这意味着我们可以利用这些技术进行个性化、渐进式的学习。值得庆幸的是，我们在2018年就开始逐步推行利用个人电子学习设备进行一对一教学，这使我们在2021年全面推行“中学生数码学习计划（PDLP）”时占得先机。我们希望我们学生能利用技术进行学习，同时学习技术去解决实际问题。

技术只是用来学习和解决问题的工具，这是我们对于技术应持有的思维方式。同时，我也在带领老师们通过一些校本课程努力培养学生们的批评性思维、创意思维和设计思维。这些思维与技能将能帮助学生们更好地运用技术，更高效地为他人创造价值，进而造福社会。

从根本上讲，全面而均衡的教育是必不可少的。我们将努力为学生提供多元的平台，让他们得以展示他们的领导才能、个性品质、学习热情和对社会的热爱；我们将努力为学生创造机会，让他们得以追求自己的兴趣，同时回馈社会。惟其如此，我们方可实现所定下的培养富有同情心的公仆领袖的目标，我们方可为圣中学子们提供向一个可以灌输信、忠、敬、毅、圣洁、正义等价值观的育人环境。

圣中的学子们已经证明，他们的热情、活力和魄力足以让他们追随生命的彩虹，他们的天赋与才华必让他们成为时代的弄潮儿。
