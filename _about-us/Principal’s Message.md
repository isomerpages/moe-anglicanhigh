	A very warm welcome to Anglican High School (AHS)! As we approach our 70th year of service to society, we are grateful to God for His many blessings to us as a vibrant learning community founded on traditional Chinese values and Christian beliefs.  Set up in 1956 by 5 Chinese speaking congregations of the Anglican Diocese in Singapore, the school has progressed over time to become a leading educational institution providing a quality brand of holistic education for all students passing through its gates. AHS is Singapore’s only Protestant SAP secondary school and this unique identity has indelibly shaped the ethos of the school positively over the years.</p>
<p align="justify">
AHS’s tradition of excellence extends beyond the academic field. With its philosophical approach of 学做人, where students learn what it means to thrive as contributing citizens and purposeful individuals in the 21st century, all the while holding on to sound values and traditions, which ground them for life’s many changes and challenges. In short, AHS seeks to support the development of graduates who shine academically and more importantly, contribute to their families and communities through an outworking of prosocial values. They are accomplished individuals who instinctively seek not their own interests but that of others first, reflecting both Christian servant leadership and the communitarian spirit of Chinese leaders. The Chinese saying ‘取之于社会，用之于社会’ is apt here and best describes the spirit  of our AHS alumni  in wanting to give back.</p>
<p align="justify">
With its foundations soundly set on cherished traditions, AHS actively has an eye on the future, actively utilising pedagogies that encourage students to acquire and develop 21st century competencies such as adaptive thinking; these are the important competencies that keep our students flourishing both in the present and future ages. In a fast-changing world, our graduates need to be fluent in these areas to thrive and AHS provides the appropriate amount of challenge and support in our Student Development Experiences to prepare them to be so. Our Signature programmes such as ACTSperience, iSCoRe and the AHS Global Classroom, etc are designed to not only stimulate our students cognitively, but also to support their understanding of varying contexts and perspectives and knowing how to customise their actions to suit particular purposes. </p>
<p align="justify">
Ultimately, we believe that every AHS student has the potential to succeed in a large variety of fields. With the right challenge and nurturing from the entire community, they are capable of achieving great things and doing the “wonderful works” (Ephesians 2:10) that God has prepared for them in advance to do. At the same time, we also provide an environment where students feel accepted, loved and a sense of belonging, not because of what they achieve in life, but because they are God’s creation, “fearfully and wonderfully made” (Psalm 139:14) first and foremost. In such a school, students feel safe to grow by learning from mistakes, picking themselves up from failures as these setbacks do not define them, but are rather part and parcel of the process of learning and growing.</p>

热烈欢迎您来到圣公会中学！不久后，圣中即将迈入第七十个年头，同时得以延续将华族传统价值观和基督信仰根植于圣中学子之中的伟业，打造一个活跃的学习社群，我心存感恩。圣公会中学于1956年由圣公会新加坡教区的五间华文堂会创办，逐年成长，如今已成为一所提供全方位优质教育的顶尖学府。圣中是新加坡唯一一所基督教新教的特别辅助计划学校，其独特的身份也对塑造圣中价值观起到正面、积极的作用。</p>
<p align="justify">
圣中力求卓越的优良传统不限制于学术领域。秉着“学做人”的处事理念，圣中学子学会如何在二十一世纪立足，成为一位有抱负、有目标的人，以及一位为社会做出贡献的公民，同时谨记在人生道路中遇到变化和挑战时可派上用场的传统价值观。简言之，圣中不仅仅培养可在学术领域有优异表现的学生，但更重要的是让学生关心社会，展现出与亲社会价值观相关的行为，从而继续为家庭和社会做出贡献。他们可以有一番作为，同时也应出自于本能先为他人的利益着想。这正好与基督信仰中的服务型领导精神和华人领袖中体恤他人、关爱社会的含义相同。正所谓“取之于社会，用之于社会”，这对圣中的毕业生而言仍有其相关性，时时提醒自己需关爱社会、造福社会、回馈社会。</p>
<p align="justify">
圣中视华族传统价值观为核心，奠定教育基础，同时也不忘着眼未来，积极运用各种教学法，以鼓励学生培养并掌握如适应式学习思维等二十一世纪技能。掌握这些至关重要的技能，有助于让我们的学生在现今与未来发挥所长。在瞬息万变的时代，若要在社会中立足，我们的毕业生需在各领域中有所表现，发挥自如。有鉴于此，圣中秉着因材施教的教学理念，为学生制定一套学习发展课程，如批判性思维体验课程（ACTSperience）、结合食品和消费者教育课程和设计与科技课程的“iSCoRe”综合课程，以及圣中环球课室课程，适度挑战学生。这些专属于圣中的特色项目旨在激发学生的思维，让他们在不同情境中进行换位思考，在满足相关需求的情况下适度调整自己的心态和行为。这皆是为了让圣中的学生做好准备，迎接未来的种种挑战。</p>
<p align="justify">
人尽其才，各司所职，我们深信所有圣中学子可在诸多领域中发挥潜能，取得成功。有了社区中诸多合作伙伴的支持，我们的学生有机会挑战自我，茁壮成长，大放异彩，更是如以弗所书第二章第十节中所述的一样，“是神所预备的，让他们有所作为”。与此同时，我们打造了一个让学生感到被接受和被爱的校园环境，让他们有归属感。之所以提供这些资源，并非是因为他们有着辉煌的成就，而正是如诗篇第一百三十九章第十四节所述一样，“是神创造了他们，而这种行为是奇妙可畏的”。身处在这样的校园中，学生有安全感，可从错误中学习，重新出发，继续成长。他们知道这些挫折是学习与成长过程中的必经之路，更不会因此决定他们的一生。</p>
